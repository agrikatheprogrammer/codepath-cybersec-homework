# Pen Testing Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. As a result of this vulnerability attackers can bypass authorization and access resources in the system directly, for example database records or files.
